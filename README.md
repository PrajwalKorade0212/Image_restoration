# Image Restoration

## Overview

This project focuses on restoring degraded or damaged images using deep learning techniques. The objective is to reconstruct high-quality images from corrupted inputs by employing various image processing and machine learning methods.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Handling of various types of image degradations.
- **Model Training**: Building and training neural network models for image restoration.
- **Image Restoration**: Applying trained models to restore and enhance images.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Directory containing the trained models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks with detailed implementation and experimentation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: Directory containing the results of the image restoration process.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess Data**:
    Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to preprocess your image data.

2. **Train the Model**:
    Train the model using the Jupyter Notebooks provided in the `notebooks/` directory or the scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

3. **Restore Images**:
    Apply the trained models to restore and enhance images. Example usage:
    ```python
    from scripts.restore import restore_image
    restored_image = restore_image('path_to_degraded_image')
    ```

4. **Evaluate Results**:
    Evaluate the performance of the restoration using metrics and visualization tools provided in the project.
